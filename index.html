        <p class="subp_a">
            Hello, I’m Benjamin! I am a sophomore studying Computer Science, Game Design at the University of California,
            Santa Cruz.
        </p>

            Right now I'm working at Tech4Good Lab, creating interfaces for learning platforms that will change the way we teach STEM.
            I'm also a Learning Support Services tutor, helping my fellow students get into engineering and find community at our school.
            I'm interested in researching computer science, education, game design, and putting my skills to the test!
        </p>

            I’m interested in cooperating with other engineers to build our knowledge and learn to develop
            effective, inclusive teams. That’s why I became a tutor.
            I believe that if we truly listen to one another, and utilize our diverse set of experiences as students and engineers,
            we can create a welcoming and empowering place of learning.

            I have experience serving the public, from children and teens, to adults and seniors. I have worked at a
            local library, helped organize and run two blood drives, fed our community at Food Not Bombs, and cared for
            animals at the Santa Cruz SPCA. For more on what I can contribute, be sure to read my resume. I look forward
            to working with you!
